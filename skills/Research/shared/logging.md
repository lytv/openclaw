# Research Logging Utility

This reference defines how to log research activities for debugging, auditing, and performance tracking.

## Unified Logging Location

**All logging consolidated into**: `.cybos/logs/MMDD-YY.md`

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all daily activity, research workflow execution, agent status, MCP calls, and errors

**Why consolidated**:
- Reduces overhead (1 file instead of 3)
- Easier to track complete workflow execution
- Simpler to audit and analyze
- Better chronological view of all activity

## Log Entry Format

All entries use the same base format with additional context based on event type:

```markdown
## HH:MM | category | type | subject
- [Context-specific fields]

---
```

## Logging Best Practices

1. **Log immediately** - Log events as they happen, not batched at end
2. **Be specific** - Include relevant details for debugging
3. **Be concise** - One-line summaries, not paragraphs
4. **Log failures** - Especially important for pattern identification
5. **Estimate costs** - Track spending per research type
6. **Don't log sensitive data** - No API keys, no personal info
7. **Chronological order** - Events logged as they occur

## Integration with Workflows

Workflows should log at these points:

```
1. START
   └─ Log workflow-start

2. GATHER (parallel MCP calls)
   └─ Log each MCP call with status/cost

3. ANALYZE (parallel agents)
   └─ Log agent-complete or agent-failed for each

4. SYNTHESIZE
   └─ Log data-quality issues if conflicts found

5. OUTPUT
   └─ Log workflow completion with summary
```

## Cost Estimation

### Perplexity
- `search`: ~$0.01-0.03 per query
- `research` (basic): ~$0.10-0.20 per query
- `research` (deep): ~$0.30-0.50 per query

### Exa (PRIMARY)
- `search`: ~$0.01-0.02 per query
- `getContents`: ~$0.02-0.05 per batch (1-10 URLs)
- `findSimilar`: ~$0.01-0.02 per query

### Parallel Search (FALLBACK)
- `web_search_preview`: ~$0.02-0.04 per query
- `web_fetch`: ~$0.03-0.05 per batch

### Parallel Task
- `createDeepResearch` (standard): ~$0.20-0.40 per task
- `createDeepResearch` (deep): ~$0.60-1.50 per task

### Firecrawl (LAST RESORT)
- `scrape`: ~$0.03-0.05 per URL (use only if exa fails)
- `extract`: ~$0.10-0.20 per batch (rarely needed)

### Playwright
- Per action: ~$0.05-0.10
- Full session: ~$0.50-1.00

## Performance Analysis

Use daily logs to track:
- Average research duration by type and intensity
- Agent success/failure rates
- MCP call success rates and fallback patterns
- Cost per research type
- Data quality trends

- market-researcher: 100% (18/18)
- financial-researcher: 85% (17/20)

## MCP Success Rates
- perplexity: 98% (45/46)

- exa getContents: 96% (24/25) - reliable content extraction
- parallel-search: 100% (15/15) - good fallback
- parallel-task: 100% (12/12)
- firecrawl: 95% (3/3 last-resort uses only)

## Cost Tracking
- Total: 15 reports, $8.45
- Average: $0.56 per report
- By intensity: Quick $0.03, Standard $0.35, Deep $1.20
